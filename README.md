# IoT Simulation W/ MQTT and ZigBee Protocols

My aim in this project is to simulate a system that enables the transmission and observation of requested sensor parameters in forests, fields, deserts, national parks or similar external natural habitats, thanks to ZigBee and MQTT technologies. CupCarbon simulation environment is used for sensor data and ZigBee protocol.

The data obtained from the simulated environment using ZigBee + MQTT protocols was transferred in real time to the cloud and to an interface that we can monitor.

- Sensor data obtained by the ZigBee network is transferred to the machine (computer) thanks to the coordinator.
- The computer-generated client broadcasts sensor data.
